## News

🚩 Updates

- 🔥🔥 Our follow-up work, [**VIP: Visual-guided Prompt Evolution for Efficient Dense Vision-Language Inference**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.12325), has been accepted to **ICML 2026**. This work introduces DINOv3-equipped dino.txt instead of CLIP to solve OVSS, and identify the limited semantic capacity canonical name to anchor the predicted results.

- 🔥 SFP currently supports the generated alias and soft aggregation in [**VIP**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.12325) to enhance the semantical express of CLIP. It also supports the evaluation on OVDG benchmarks introduced by  [**S2_Corr**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18853) of CVPR 2026. Check [configs](https://github.com/Kimsure/SFP/tree/main/SFP_ICCV/configs) for details.

## Abstract

Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation has advanced with vision-language models like CLIP, which exhibit strong zero-shot abilities. However, CLIP’s attention mechanism often wrongly emphasises specific image tokens, namely outliers, which results in irrelevant over-activation. Existing approaches struggle with these outliers that arise in intermediate layers and propagate through the model, ultimately degrading spatial perception. In this paper, we propose a Self-adaptive Feature Purifier framework (SFP) to suppress propagated outliers and enhance semantic representations for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Specifically, based on an in-depth analysis of attention responses between image and class tokens, we design a selfadaptive outlier mitigator to detect and mitigate outliers at each layer for propagated feature purification. In addition, we introduce a semantic-aware attention enhancer to augment attention intensity in semantically relevant regions, which strengthens the purified feature to focus on objects. Further, we introduce a hierarchical attention integrator to aggregate multi-layer attention maps to refine spatially coherent feature representations for final segmentation. Our proposed SFP enables robust outlier suppression and object-centric feature representation, leading to a more precise segmentation. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by an average of 4.6% mIoU on eight segmentation benchmarks.


## Visualization of Outlier Propagation
You can check and verify the attention outlier at [Notebook](outlier_vis.ipynb).

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Kimsure/SFP.git
cd SFP
```

### 1) Recommended

Please use the following commands to install the same conda environment.
```
conda env create f environment.yml
```

### 2) Manual Setup

If the above YAML file can't work properly, you can manually install the following required packages.

```
conda create -n sfp_ovss python=3.9
conda activate sfp_ovss
pip install torch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.1
pip install scikit-learn scikit-image
pip install mim 
mim install mmcv==2.0.1 mmengine==0.8.4 mmsegmentation==1.1.1 # If you want to visualize the class names in the segmentation map, try to update mmsegmentation>=1.2.2
pip install ftfy regex numpy==1.26.4 yapf==0.40.1
```

If some errors occur, please try the following operation based on my experimence.

Error occurs when installing mim
```
pip install openmim 
```
Error occurs when opencv version is complicated with mmcv framework.
```
pip install opencv-python==4.10.0.84 
```

## Datasets
We include the following dataset configurations in this repo:

**With background class**: PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, Cityscapes, ADE20k, and COCO-Stuff164k,

**Without background class**: VOC20, Context59 (i.e., PASCAL VOC and PASCAL Context without the background category), and COCO-Object.

Plase follow [SCLIP](https://github.com/wangf3014/SCLIP) and [mmsegentation_document](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/docs/en/user_guides/2_dataset_prepare.md) for detailed configurations.

## Quick Start
We currently provide a visualization notebook to evaluate the outler detector. You can check and verify it at [NOTEBOOK](outlier_vis.ipynb).

## Inference
You can use the following bash scripts to evaluate our SFP (on RTX4090 or other GPU devices). Remember adjusting your own **MODEL/DATASET PATH**. 

Single inference 
```
sh test.sh
```

Multiple inference 
```
sh multi_test.sh
```

Distributed inferece 
```
sh distribute_test.sh
```

### Ablations

You may want to check and reproduce the visualization results shown in out [NOTEBOOK](outlier_vis.ipynb). Please turn to [base_config.py](./configs/base_config.py) and use **'purify'** and **'pm'** to control whether to use outlier detection and its various methods.

## TODOs
We are still organizing our codes and will release the remaining parts once ready. Please stay tuned.
